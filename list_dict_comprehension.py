# List and Dict Comprehension

# Basic
squares = [i**2 for i in range(0,10)]

# Advanced

# Using 1 conditional in comprehensions

# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']

# Create list comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = [member for member in fellowship if len(member) >= 7]

# Print the new list
print(new_fellowship)

# Using 2 conditionals in comprehensions

# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']

# Create list comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = [member if len(member) >= 7 else "" for member in fellowship]

# Print the new list
print(new_fellowship)


# Dict comprehension

# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']

# Create dict comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = {member: len(member) for member in fellowship}

# Print the new dictionary
print(new_fellowship)
